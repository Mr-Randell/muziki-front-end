# Phase 4 Final Project : Muziki App

![Muziki-app](/public/muziki.png "Muziki-app")

## N/B: Most commits were made to the 'DEVELOP' branch for the purpose of error control such that final approved version is merged into the main branch

## Focus 🎯
Building a MUSIC APP API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.

## Learning Goals 👨‍🚀

- Interact with a database to feed data into the components.
- Have a minimum of Four models with a one-to-many relationship.
- Create API routes in Ruby on Rails that handles at least Four different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models.
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
